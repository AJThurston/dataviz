@fig1 demonstrates the negative relationship between displacement and highway milage.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#| label: fig1
#| warning: false
p <- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) 
p <- p + geom_point()
p <- p + geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = "loess")
p
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

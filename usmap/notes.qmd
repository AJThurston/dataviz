I've published the fiftystater R package on GitHub (devtools::install_github("wmurphyrd/fiftystater")) to provide a simple solution. It is based on the steps from Spacedman's answer (would link but insufficient rep) and is published as a ggplot2::geom_map ready shape data frame named fifty_states to remove the need to install dependencies, track down a source shape file, or tweak elide values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(mapproj)
library(fiftystater)

crimes <- data.frame(state = tolower(rownames(USArrests)), USArrests)

p <- ggplot(crimes, aes(map_id = state)) + 
  geom_map(aes(fill = Assault), map = fifty_states) + 
  expand_limits(x = fifty_states$long, y = fifty_states$lat) +
  coord_map()
p
```
